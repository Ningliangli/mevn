# mevn
MEVN is a framework for an easy starting point with MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEVN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
